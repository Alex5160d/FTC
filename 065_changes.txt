MENU
	Prevent target frame from disappearing while repositioning elements

FRAMES
	Add group health bar buffering to limit the number of effective updates that are processed per second. This should further improve FTC performance in trial and large pvp group situations.
	Correct a bug with the tracking of werewolf transformation timer in player frames.
	Apply localization function to player titles

BUFFS
	Add correct cast time to Magicka Detonation and morphs
	Corrected buff detection of Dark Shades.
	Do not purge the Hardened Armor buff when it's damage shield is consumed.
	Improve the display of Vampirism and Lycanthropy on players. Vampirism will be shown with the tag "V1" through "V4" depending on the player's vampirism stage. Lycanthropy is displayed with the tag "W".
	Override standard debuff display logic to always show the timer of your most recent taunt even if you are no longer targetting the taunted target. This is something of a temporary holdover until I develop a better system built into FTC for taunt tracking.

SCT
	Add option to change the scroll direction for outgoing and incoming text (up/down)

LOG
	FTC will no long minimize chat on UI reload unless the Alternate With Chat setting is enabled.
	Prevent triggering an error from using the Toggle Combat Log button when the Combat Log is disabled.
