FTC 0.66 Changes


UNIT FRAMES
	Fix UI error with group member shields if small group frames were enabled, large group frames were disabled, and the player was in a group larger than 4 members.
	Continue improving efficiency of unit frame updating to hopefully resolve some performance issues.
	Remove raid frame individual member combat fading to improve raid frame performance.
	Force a /reloadui when group or raid frames are enabled or disabled to avoid collisions with other unit frames addons.
	Minor aesthetic improvements to raid frames.

BUFFS
	Add Major Sorcery buff tracking to Entropy and Degeneration as intended. 
	Change ability bar keypress tracking to use zo_prehook method.

SCT
	Brightened font color for entered/left combat alerts.


DAMAGE STATS
	Change the default setting for sharing group DPS to disabled. Your saved variable setting for this will be forced to "off" when you update. If you want to use this feature you must go back into settings and re-enable it.
	Add additional checks to DPS sharing to filter out bad data. Damage will no longer be shared for fights shorter than 10 seconds.
